\title{Calculates atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (kPa) based on altitude and selected method}
\usage{
atmPressure(alt, method = "isa")
}
\arguments{
\item{alt}{numeric, the altitude in meters above sea level.}

\item{method}{character, the method to be used for calculating atmospheric pressure. Default is "isa" and allows for selection between "isa" and "equation".}
}
\value{
The function returns a number in kilopascals (kPa) that corresponds to the atmospheric pressure based on the input altitude and selected method.
}
\description{
The "atmPressure()" function allows for the calculation of atmospheric pressure in kilopascals (kPa) based on the input altitude and selected method. Two methods can be selected: the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model and a simplified equation based on the ideal gas law at a standard temperature of 20Â°C.
}
\note{
It is important to note that the simplified equation based on the ideal gas law is an approximation and does not take into account factors such as humidity and air pollution, so its accuracy may vary in real-world conditions.
